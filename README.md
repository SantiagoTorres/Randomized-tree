# Randomized-tree
A small script to draw a randomized BST of arbitrary length

## How to get this
clone or download the zip file and get the dependencies:

```Bash
$ pip install pybst
$ pip install matplotlib
$ pip install networkx
```

## How to run:

```Bash
$ python make_tree.py [size] 
```

It defaults for a size of 10 and I've tested it up to 50. Feel free to play
around and tell me if there are any problems.
